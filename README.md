Hand Gesture Recognition CNN Model
Overview
This project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model built using the TensorFlow library for the purpose of hand gesture recognition. The model is trained to distinguish between 10 different hand shapes or states. Hand gesture recognition has applications in various fields, including sign language interpretation, human-computer interaction, and virtual reality.

Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the CNN model can be obtained from [insert dataset source or link here]. The dataset consists of images of hand gestures, each labeled with one of the 10 different hand states.
